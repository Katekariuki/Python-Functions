# ✍️ Understand Python Functions Using this Simple Practice Exercise 
---
In python, a function is a block of code designed to perform specific tasks and it also packages a code for reuse. Functions take arguements and in some instances they do not need to ccept an arguement in which case the function will be called without passing any arguement. 
Types of functions include:
- Defining functions
- Lambda functions
- Recursive functions

Below are practice questions on how to declare functions; the attached document contains sample functions and the use of input and f-strings while declaring functions

1. Declare a function add_two_numbers. It takes two parameters and it returns a sum.
2. Area of a circle is calculated as follows: area = π x r x r. Write a function that calculates area_of_circle.
3. Write a function called add_all_nums which takes arbitrary number of arguments and sums all the arguments. Check if all the list items are number types. If not do give  a reasonable feedback.
4. Temperature in °C can be converted to °F using this formula: °F = (°C x 9/5) + 32. Write a function which converts °C to °F, convert_celsius_to-fahrenheit.
5. Write a function called check-season, it takes a month parameter and returns the season: Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer.
6. Write a function called calculate_slope which return the slope of a linear equation
7. Quadratic equation is calculated as follows: ax² + bx + c = 0. Write a function which calculates solution set of a quadratic equation, solve_quadratic_eqn.
8. Declare a function named print_list. It takes a list as a parameter and it prints out each element of the list.
